      <h1>Juventus F.C</h1>
      <h2>A LEGEND IS BORN</h2>
      <img src="img/early_juve.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        It all began with a bench on Corso Re Umberto, one of the most famous
        streets in city centre Turin. A group of friends congregated on this
        bench. They all possessed a shared passion for football, a special game
        that had recently been ‘imported’ from England. They had an intriguing
        idea, to create a sports club. The boys attended the ‘Massimo D’Azeglio’
        high school which specialised in classical studies. They were well
        educated but the eldest was just 17 years of age. This paved the way for
        the club’s name. In Latin, the name ‘Juventus’ means youth. They weren’t
        aware of it yet, but on 1 November 1897, they had given birth to a
        legend. And so Italy’s greatest football team was born, almost by
        chance. The club’s first President was Enrico Canfari, the first ground
        was Piazza d’Armi (Parade Ground) and the side started out wearing pink.
        Sporting that same jersey, the club made its debut in the national
        championship in 1900. Three years later, the Bianconeri colours, which
        had come from Nottingham, were in use. Five years later, the first
        Italian title arrived when Juve successfully beat off stiff competition
        from Genoa and Milanese. President AlfredoDick from Switzerland, left
        the club shortly afterwards following various complaints and rifts in
        the dressing room. He then went on to found Torino FC, bringing the best
        foreign players from Juventus with him. Juventus then endured some
        difficult years as they failed to keep pace with the new footballing
        superpowers of the time, Pro Vercelli and Casale. The Bianconeri made a
        triumphant return following the First World War: goalkeeper Giacone and
        defenders Novo and Bruna were the first Juventus players to wear the
        National Team’s jersey. The President was poet and scholar Corradino
        Corradini, who also wrote the club anthem which was used until the
        1960s. 1923 was a special year as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all
        time, Giampiero Combi, made his first team debut. He would go on to
        contribute heavily to a change in the club’s standing. On 24 July, a
        shareholders’ meeting saw Mr Edoardo Agnelli, son of the founder of
        FIAT, elected as the new president. The club also now had its very own
        playing surface in Corso Marsiglia. The terraces were just bricks but
        the number of supporters increased day by day. Juventus had all the
        foundations to rise through the ranks of Italian football and to
        strengthen a side already boasting the likes of Combi, Rosetta,
        Munerati, Bigatto and Grabbi. Then came the the first official manager,
        Hungarian Jeno Karoly, and the first foreign world-beater, Hungarian
        left-winger Hirzer. In 1925/26 Juventus won their second Scudetto title
        following a gripping regional final against Bologna and then a
        resounding 12-1 aggregate win in the national final against Alba Roma.
        But this was just the beginning. From 1930 to 1935, Juve were streets
        ahead of the rest as five consecutive Scudetto trophies made their way
        to Turin. The main ingredients of the ‘Golden five-year period’ were the
        manager Carlo Carcano and champions such as Orsi, Caligaris, Monti,
        Cesarini, Varglien I and II, Bertolini, Ferrari and Borel II. Juve also
        made a significant contribution to the national side, who won the World
        Cup in Rome in 1934. The 1930s saw the Bianconeri have their first
        experience in a continental competition when they took part in the
        European Cup, currently known as the Champions League. Although luck was
        not on Juve’s side, they did manage to make four semi-final appearances.
        Juventus resumed their success after the Second World War. Following the
        tragic death of Edoardo Agnelli in a plane crash in 1935, his son,
        Giovanni, took on the role of president in 1947. The club’s most revered
        champions at the time were Carlo Parola, Danish duo John Hansen and
        Praest and, most notable of all, Giampiero Boniperti. Cheered on by
        thousands of fans, they recorded Scudetto triumphs in 1950and 1952. In
        1953, Giovanni Agnelli stepped down from the presidency and it was then
        passed onto his brother Umberto two years later. Juve were on the brink
        of another triumphant cycle. The arrivals of Omar Sivoriand John Charles
        helped the Bianconeri to the Scudetto title in 1958 which allowed them
        to wear a star on their shirts to mark ten national championship
        victories. The club recorded three further successes during the 1960s,
        with the last coming in 1967 under the presidency of Vittore Catella.
        However, the start of the new decade yielded even greater additions to
        the Juventus history books. Giampiero Boniperti may have hung up his
        boots, but he continued to lead the team by taking on the role of
        President on 13 July 1971. After this, there was no stopping the
        Bianconeri.

      <h2>The best team on the planet</h2>
      <img src="img/juve_the_best.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        In 1990, Giampiero Boniperti handed the presidential reins over to Mr
        Vittorio Caissotti di Chiusano. Three years later, Juventus clinched
        their third UEFA Cup, but had also experienced a barren run on the
        domestic front. In 1994, the club began a process of renovation.
        Chiusano remained as president, but operating positions were given to
        Roberto Bettega, Antonio Giraudo and Luciano Moggi. MAY 22, 1996 -
        CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE Marcelo Lippi was managing the side and several new
        faces had entered the squad such as: Ferrara in defence, Paulo Sousa and
        Deschamps in midfield and up front, alongside Gianluca Vialli and
        Roberto Baggio, was an interesting young player. He had joined Juventus
        in the previous year from Padova, showing a notable technique and a
        strong personality. His name was Alessandro Del Piero, the man who would
        go on to rewrite all Juventus records. The following season was defined
        by an endless duel with Parma, who managed to overcome Juve in the UEFA
        cup final. However, the Bianconeri beat their rivals in the Scudetto
        title race and also ran out winners against them in the Coppa Italia
        final. The year was a great success but also one that was marked by
        tragedy because of the death of Andrea Fortunato on 25th April 1995
        after he suffered from an incurable disease. The Scudetto victory
        allowed Juve to claim their place in the Champions League the following
        year where they knocked out Real Madrid in the quarter-finals and then
        beat Nantes in the semis. The final was to be played in Rome against
        reigning champions Ajax. On 22 May 1996, it ended 1-1. The Bianconeri
        had scored all their penalties and keeper Peruzzi had saved two. Jugovic
        approached the penalty spot smiling for the last spot kick. His smile
        turned to a cry of joy after a few seconds as Juve were crowned
        Champions of Europe. The squad underwent drastic changes in the
        following season as Vialli and Ravanelli both left, while Boksic, Vieri
        and Amoruso came in. Montero and Zidane also joined to bolster the
        defence and midfield respectively. The Bianconeri were then back on the
        top of the world after Del Piero’s goal clinched victory against River
        Plate in the Intercontinental Cup held in Tokyo. The team also achieved
        another Scudetto title, but a second consecutive Champions League final
        was to end on a low, as former Bianconeri players Moeller and Paulo
        Sousa took the trophy to Germany. European heartbreak was to repeat
        itself the following year as the Bianconeri again stumbled at the final
        hurdle, this time in Amsterdam against Real Madrid. However the club
        recorded its 25th Scudetto title largely thanks to the fine form
        displayed by Inzaghi and Del Piero. The following season, Del Piero
        suffered an injury on 8 November 1998 in Udine. Without their guiding
        light, Juventus struggled to maintain their rhythm and Lippi gave way to
        Carlo Ancelotti on the bench. Following two unsuccessful seasons, Lippi
        returned home in 2001. The manager from Viareggio took charge of a team
        that had lost the key figures of Inzaghi and Zidane but he was able to
        count on the vital signings of Buffon, Thuram and Nedved. The
        championship went right down to the wire. On the final matchday of the
        season, Inter were out in front and playing against Lazio in Rome.
        Meanwhile Juventus were in action against away against Udinese. Lippi’s
        side were quick out of the blocks and had established a two-goal lead in
        the space of just 15 mintues. Inter, on the other hand, went into the
        interval on level terms but then conceded twice after the restart to
        bring their title challenge to an end. Scudetto number 26 will be
        remembered for Del Piero and Trezeguet’s immense joy, coupled with
        Ronaldo’s tears. The Scudetto shield remained on Juve’s shirt for the
        following season, but it was a tragic year nonetheless. ‘Avvocato’
        Giovanni Agnelli died on 24 January 2003 and the club was in mourning.
        In May, Juventus suffered another setback as they lost the Champions
        League final on penalties at Wembley against Milan. 15 July 2003 proved
        to be a historic date for the club as Juventus entered into an agreement
        with the City of Turin for the acquisition of the Stadio Delle Alpi land
        rights, where the new stadium would eventually be built. In the
        meantime, the Bianconeri exacted revenge on Milan by claiming victory in
        the Super Cup which was contested in the USA. However, the party did not
        last too long as the death of President Vittorio Caissotti di Chiusano
        was announced. Franzo Grande Stevens, Vice-President of FIAT stepped
        into the role. Aside from the Super Cup victory, the remainder of the
        season was unfulfilling for Juve. The club was again in deep mourning
        the following spring as Umberto Agnelli passed away on 27 May 2004.

      <p>
        2015-2016 SEASON The summer of 2015, in many ways, marked a new dawn in
        the evolution of the side with several changes made to personnel. As
        Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal, Carlos Tevez and Fernando Llorente all bid
        farewell to Turin, the likes of Paulo Dybala, Sami Khedira, Mario
        Mandzukic, Simone Zaza, Juan Cuadrado and Alex Sandro entered the
        picture as 10 new players in total joined the Bianconeri ranks. The
        season began with the club’s seventh Italian Super Cup thanks to a 2-0
        triumph over Lazio in Shanghai, but they were suffering an especially
        slow start to their Serie A campaign. After 10 games, the Old Lady found
        herself in 12th place and far away from reaching her objective of
        claiming an historic fifth successive Scudetto title. Then, following a
        humbling defeat away to Sassuolo, senior squad members Gianluigi Buffon
        and Patrice Evra called for change and for the group’s true, winning
        character to re-emerge. The team needed little time in heeding these
        words and, from their derby triumph over Torino later that week, would
        go on to win 25 from their next 26 games in the league. Meanwhile, they
        would put on a strong showing in the Champions League, in which they
        ultimately fell just short of overcoming a brilliant Bayern Munich side
        in the last 16 stage. Back on the domestic front, Allegri’s charges
        would not let their phenomenal run of form dip once and by 13 February
        they had overtaken Napoli at the top of the table after beating the
        Partenopei in a pulsating encounter at Juventus Stadium. Following
        victory away to Fiorentina on 25 April, Juve were on the cusp of
        completing arguably the most extraordinary of comebacks in Italian
        football history to claim a fifth consecutive league crown for the first
        time since their first Quinquennio celebration in 1935. The feat would
        be confirmed the following day when Roma defeated second-placed Napoli
        at the Stadio Olimpico – the scene of the Old Lady’s very next
        trophy-winning night, namely the Coppa Italia. By beating Milan 1-0 in
        extra-time in the capital, the Bianconeri created yet more history by
        becoming the first ever Italian team to win the league and cup double in
        consecutive campaigns. 2016-2017 SEASON The summer of 2016 saw the
        Bianconeri bolster their ranks considerably. The arrivals of Miralem
        Pjanic, Dani Alves, Medhi Benatia, Marko Pjaca and club-record signing
        Gonzalo Higuain made for an exceptionally competitive squad. Juve would
        sit top of the league table all the way from mid-September until the end
        of the season as they cruised to a legendary sixth straight Serie A
        title – an unprecedented feat in Italian football. Furthermore,
        Allegri’s men conquered their third consecutive Coppa Italia – another
        feat never achieved before in this country – by beating Lazio 2-0 in
        Rome. They would also reach the Champions League final for a second time
        in three seasons, beating formidable opponents in Porto, Barcelona and
        Monaco en route to the showpiece event in Cardiff, where Real Madrid
        ultimately prevailed. Nevertheless, this had been another extraordinary
        campaign for the boys in black and white. 2017/18 SEASON There are some
        seasons which are quickly forgotten in the history of football, filed
        away in the archives to gather dust. 2017/18 certainly wouldn’t fall
        into this category, as this campaign saw two milestones which will
        forever be remembered in Juventus history. After #Hi5tory and #Le6end,
        on 13 May 2018 came #My7h – a seventh consecutive Scudetto success, just
        a few days after our fourth back-to-back Coppa Italia triumph. On 1 July
        2017 the club announced the creation of Juventus Women, a pioneering
        move by a club known for its trailblazing moves. The newly formed team
        wasted no time in making themselves known, going on to win the Scudetto
        in their maiden season. 2018/19 SEASON Seven Scudetti in a row may have
        been the stuff of legend, but Max Allegri and his charges were still
        hungry for more. The 2018/19 season was yet another memorable chapter in
        the club’s history. Juve, who already boasted a star-studded squad,
        reinforced their ranks during the summer. While Emre Can, Leonardo
        Spinazzola, Mattia Perin, Joao Cancelo, and the returning Leonardo
        Bonucci were vital additions, the icing on the cake was the arrival of
        Cristiano Ronaldo. The Bianconeri forged even further ahead of their
        closest rivals, winning the league title with five matches to spare -
        yet another #W8nderful league conquest. Elsewhere, Juventus Women
        claimed their second successive Scudetto, proving to the world that they
        were #Here2Stay. What's more, 2018/19 marked the first time Allianz
        Stadium hosted a women’s match as a record-breaking 40,000 fans saw Juve
        take on Fiorentina. This season also saw the start of another club
        project, with Juventus Next Gen making their Serie C debut. 2019/20
        SEASON A different coach at the helm in Maurizio Sarri, but the same
        result. While Juve men’s finished only a point clear of their rivals,
        they still made it nine times in a row, while the women recorded their
        third straight league conquest. The height of the Covid-19 pandemic was
        an unprecedented period for us all. Forced into isolation from everyone
        and everything we had ever known, months of uncertainty followed in
        which fans couldn’t even take solace in regular football matches. When
        three months later the situation had improved enough for games to
        resume, the atmosphere felt in the empty stadiums was one of profound
        sadness. Yet Juve put this aside and sauntered on to win a ninth league
        title in a row, the 38th in our history, with two games to spare.
        #STRON9ER than everything and everyone else - a victory for the fans,
        those still watching, those who had been left behind. While the men’s
        league was able to resume, Juventus Women didn’t return to the field of
        play that season but were declared winners by default, proving
        themselves #Lead3rs once more. Meanwhile, Juventus Next Gen side brought
        another smile to Juve faces, winning the Serie C Coppa Italia, their
        first-ever trophy conquest. 2020/21 SEASONT 2020/21 saw Juventus take
        another step in their evolution, once again ringing the changes in the
        dugout. Club legend Andrea Pirlo became coach, leading a squad full of
        fresh faces such as Arthur, Federico Chiesa, Dejan Kulusevski and Weston
        McKennie, the first American to represent the Bianconeri. Along with
        these youngsters came a more experienced and familiar face in Spanish
        international Alvaro Morata. This Serie A season was much more closely
        fought than previous years, with Juve finishing fourth to seal
        qualification for the Champions League. Nevertheless, there were some
        new additions to Juventus’s already bulging trophy cabinet. The men
        overcame Napoli in the Italian Super Cup in January and Atalanta in the
        Coppa Italia in May, while Rita Guarino’s women also secured Super Cup
        win in the same month before going on to being crowned Scudetto winners
        at the end of another #F4bulous campaign. On a personal level,
        Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo finished top of the Serie A
        scoring charts, proving his quality time and time again. SEASON
        2021-2022: The 2021-2022 season sees the Men's First Team go close to
        winning two trophies: the Coppa Italia and the Italian Super Cup, whilst
        managing to qualify for the Champions League with a few matchdays to
        spare before the end of the championship. The Juventus Museum trophy
        room, however, is still enriched with three new cups, and it’s made
        possible thanks to an incredible treble by Juventus Women. At the
        beginning of the season the team undergoes a big change with the arrival
        of Joe Montemurro, but what doesn’t change is the attitude, mentality,
        and strength of the Bianconere, who in January '22 bring home the
        Italian Super Cup, following a final four mini-tournament, beating Milan
        in the final. Juventus Women also win their fifth-consecutive Scudetto,
        in their fifth year since inception and, to finish with a flourish, they
        conquer the Coppa Italia at the end of May with an extraordinary
        comeback in the final against Roma. All in a season that the Juventus
        Women champions reached their best-ever finish to date in the Women’s
        Champions League, by getting to the quarter-finals, going out narrowly
        to Lyon after winning the first leg at Allianz Stadium.
